## Abstract

Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale, diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect **SpatialVID**, a dataset consisting of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes, camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses, depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than **21,000 hours** of raw videos, and process them into **2.7 million clips** through a hierarchical filtering pipeline, totaling **7,089 hours** of dynamic content. A subsequent annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video and 3D vision research community.


## Preparation

This section describes how to set up the environment manually. For a simpler, containerized setup, please refer to the **[Docker Setup and Usage](#docker-setup-and-usage)** section.

### Environment

1. Necessary packages

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/NJU-3DV/SpatialVID.git
   cd SpatialVid
   conda create -n SpatialVID python=3.10.13
   conda activate SpatialVID
   pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Package needed for scoring

   ```bash
   pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==3.0.0 -i https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/stable/cu126/
   pip install -r requirements/requirements_scoring.txt
   ```

   Ignore the warning about `nvidia-nccl-cu12` and `numpy` version, it is not a problem.

   About FFMPEG, please refer to the [`INSTALL.md`](scoring/motion/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions on how to install ffmpeg. After installation, replace the `FFMPEG_PATH` variable in the [`scoring/motion/inference.py`](scoring/motion/inference.py) and [`utils/cut.py`](utils/cut.py) with the actual path to your ffmpeg executable, default is `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`.

   ⚠️ If your videos are in av1 codec instead of h264, you need to install ffmpeg (already in our requirement script), then run the following to make conda support av1 codec:

   ```bash
   pip uninstall opencv-python
   conda install -c conda-forge opencv==4.11.0
   ```

   If unfortunately your conda environment still cannot support av1 codec, you can use the `--backend av` option in the scoring scripts to use PyAV as the video reading backend.
   But note that using PyAV for frame extraction may lead to slight inaccuracies in frame positioning.

3. Package needed for annotation

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/requirements_annotation.txt
   ```

   Compile the extensions for the camera tracking module:

   ```bash
   cd camera_pose_annotation/base
   python setup.py install
   ```

4. [Optional] Package needed for visualization

   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   pip install -e viser
   ```

### Model Weight

Download the model weights used in our experiments:

```bash
bash scripts/download_checkpoints.sh
```

Or you can manually download the model weights from the following links and place them in the appropriate directories.

| Model               | File Name               | URL                                                                                                             |

## Quick Start

The whole pipeline is illustrated in the figure below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/pipeline.png"  height=340>
</p>

1. Scoring

   ```bash
   bash scripts/scoring.sh
   ```

   Inside the [`scoring.sh`](scripts/scoring.sh) script, you need to set the following variables:

   - `ROOT_VIDEO` is the directory containing the input video files.
   - `OUTPUT_DIR` is the directory where the output files will be saved.
2. Annotation

   ```bash
   bash scripts/annotation.sh
   ```

   Inside the [`annotation.sh`](scripts/annotation.sh) script, you need to set the following variables:

   - `CSV` is the CSV file generated by the scoring script, default is `$OUTPUT_DIR/results.csv`.
   - `OUTPUT_DIR` is the directory where the output files will be saved.
3. Caption

   ```bash
   bash scripts/caption.sh
   ```

   Inside the [`caption.sh`](scripts/caption.sh) script, you need to set the following variables:

   - `CSV` is the CSV file generated by the annotation script, default is `$OUTPUT_DIR/results.csv`.
   - `SRC_DIR` is the annotation output directory, default is the same as the `OUTPUT_DIR` in the annotation step.
   - `OUTPUT_DIR` is the directory where the output files will be saved.
   - The API keys for the LLM models used in the captioning step. You can replace them with your own API keys.
4. Visualization

   - You can visualize the `poses.npy` in the `reconstruction` folder of each annotated clip using the [`visualize_pose.py`](viser/visualize_pose.py) script.
   - You can visualize the final annotation result(`sgd_cvd_hr.npz`) using the [`visualize_megasam.py`](viser/visualize_megasam.py) script.
   
   Note that if you want to visualize any clip in our dataset, you need to use the script [`pack_clip_assets.py`](utils/pack_clip_assets.py) to unify the depth, RGB frames, intrinsics, extrinsics, etc. of that clip into a single npz file first. And then you can use the visualization script to visualize it.


## Docker Setup and Usage

We provide a Dockerfile to create a fully configured environment that includes all dependencies, including a custom-built FFmpeg with NVIDIA acceleration. This is the recommended way to ensure reproducibility and avoid environment-related issues.

Before you begin, ensure your system environment is similar to the configuration below. Version matching is crucial for a successful compilation.
The GPU needs to support HEVC; refer to the [NVIDIA NVDEC Support Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA_Video_Coding_Engine#NVDEC).


### Prerequisites: Setting up the Host Environment

Before building and running the Docker container, your host machine must be configured to support GPU access for Docker.

1.  **NVIDIA Drivers**: Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed. You can verify this by running `nvidia-smi`.

2.  **Docker Engine**: Install Docker on your system. Follow the official instructions at [docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

3.  **NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: This toolkit allows Docker containers to access the host's NVIDIA GPU. Install it using the following commands (for Debian/Ubuntu):
    To run docker containers with GPU support you have to install the [nvidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). 
    ```bash
    # Add the GPG key
    curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg
    
    # Add the repository
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
      sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
    
    # Update package lists and install the toolkit
    sudo apt-get install -y \
      nvidia-container-toolkit=${NVIDIA_CONTAINER_TOOLKIT_VERSION} \
      nvidia-container-toolkit-base=${NVIDIA_CONTAINER_TOOLKIT_VERSION} \
      libnvidia-container-tools=${NVIDIA_CONTAINER_TOOLKIT_VERSION} \
      libnvidia-container1=${NVIDIA_CONTAINER_TOOLKIT_VERSION}

    # Configure Docker to use the NVIDIA runtime
    sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=containerd
    
    # Restart the Docker daemon to apply the changes
    sudo systemctl restart containerd
    ```
    For other operating systems, please refer to the [official NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

4. **Docker Image Pre-pulls [optional]**: To accelerate the build process, we provide a script to pre-pull necessary Docker images from a mirror registry.

   ```bash
   bash scripts/build_gpu_docker.sh
   ```

### Build and Run the Container

You can also build and run the image using standard Docker commands from the root of the repository.

1.  **Build the GPU image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -f Dockerfile.cuda \
      --build-arg NUM_JOBS=8 \
      -t spatialvid-gpu .
    ```

2.  **Run the container**:
    ```bash
    docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
      -v $(pwd):/workspace \
      -w /workspace \
      -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,video,utility \
      spatialvid-gpu bash
    ```

3.  **Verify the environment (inside the container)**:
    Once inside the container, you can verify that FFmpeg and PyTorch are correctly installed and can access the GPU.
    ```bash
    # Check the custom FFmpeg build
    /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -version

    # Check PyTorch and CUDA availability
    python3 -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}, CUDA: {torch.version.cuda}, GPU Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
    ```

## Dataset Download

Apart from downloading the dataset using terminal commands, we provide scripts to download the SpatialVID/SpatialVID-HQ dataset from HuggingFace. Please refer to the [`download_SpatialVID.py`](utils/download_SpatialVID.py) script for more details.

We also provide our script to download the raw videos from YouTube. You can refer to the [`download_YouTube.py`](utils/download_YouTube.py) script for more details.
